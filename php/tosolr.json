Or they can be reported using the verbatim name given by the data originator. Either the name of the controlled vocabulary or the word ¡§verbatim¡¨ should be used in this term to record the level of control over names. Verbatim means the names are not using a controlled vocabulary other than the names assigned just as they are by the data originator. Either way, within a dataset, identifiers for quantification names must be used consistently and explained in metadata. See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#quantificationVocabulary","vocab":"MBGCommonTerms"},{"term":"quantificationName","desc":"A name for a derived value or processed data about the occurrence, for example, \"Biomass\". The word used in this terminology for such information is \"quantification\", rather than \"abundance\", because the word \"abundance\" may already be associated with specific, rather than general, practices of quantification in biology. In this example, biomass would not be obtained at survey time, rather biomass would be calculated from input data that was obtained at survey time, combined with a biomass calculation methodology. This term is used along with companion terms for quantification value, units, uncertainty, method, and determination details. It is suggested that names for derived values be more specific than \"Biomass\", because many institutions will develop biomass information using diverse methods. Suggested practice is to include some more specific reference(s) in the quantification name, such as institution, survey, date or other specifics. For example, \"Biomass-PIFSC-2011\", and explain the name and method of calculation in metadata. See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#quantificationName","vocab":"MBGCommonTerms"},{"term":"quantificationValue","desc":"The value of the derived information product, such as the numerical value for biomass.

This can be reported in the units of the quantification, or as a percentage. Note that the expression in this term can combine both accuracy and precision considerations to a more general estimate uncertainty; hence the slightly different name for this term compared to the Darwin Core (dwc) reference term. See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#quantificationUncertainty","vocab":"MBGCommonTerms"},{"term":"quantificationDeterminedDate","desc":"The date the quantification was determined, expressed in ISO 8601 date format.

This will be different from the method used to make the observation of biological occurrence; it will be the companion calculation method that followed the observation method. Quantification information is expected to be useful only if method is sufficiently documented, so this term is vitally important for use of quantification terms for derived values. This term can contain a code or other abbreviated reference to a method. In all cases quantificationMethod should be explained in metadata and supporting publications or related resources identified.

See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#observationHeight","vocab":"MBGVLTS"},{"term":"sightingDistanceInMeters","desc":"For boat-based surveys: Radial distance in meters between the animal (or center of group of animals) and the vessel when the first sighting was made. This value is can be reported if 1) prior calibrations of radial distances have been made using the known observation height and the reticles on the specific types of binoculars used during the survey, and 2) sighting was detected by eye if ¡¥Naked Eye¡¦ is specified in distanceEstimationMethod. *Optional use for aerial surveys: Typically these radial sighting distances are not recorded, but they can be calculated from clinometer readings (verticalAngle) and altitude (observationHeight). If distances between the plane and the animals are provided (e.g. using lasers, or calculating distance to the trackline using GPS locations above the initial animal sightings) this information can be included in this term. See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#sightingDistanceInMeters","vocab":"MBGVLTS"},{"term":"visibilityImpairment","desc":"Description of any impairments to visibility, such as: fog, precipitation, low ceiling, haze, glare. This term will use the verbatim terminology from the data provider that may include information on the degree of impairment as well as the description of impairment type. See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#visibilityImpairment","vocab":"MBGVLTS"},{"term":"sightingCue","desc":"Description of what was seen first of the group, that is, the cue associated with the first sighting of the animal (or group of animals). A behavioral code may be used (e.g. BL = blow). Additional explanation of the role of cues in sighting may be helpful to explain in metadata. If behavioral codes are used in sightingCue, they must be used consistently within a dataset and they must be explained in metadata. See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#sightingCue","vocab":"MBGVLTS"},{"term":"vesselActivity","desc":"Description of vessel activity occurring when the animal is first sighted (e.g. periods of surveying during active sound production or periods of transit). This is to make users aware of aspects of the survey, vessel activity or observation details that may bias the detection of animals and so may impact how they select and handle dataset-specific observations in applications. See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#vesselActivity","vocab":"MBGVLTS"},{"term":"windSpeedInKnots","desc":"True wind speed in knots (removes effect of vessel course and speed). See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#windSpeedInKnots","vocab":"MBGVLTS"},{"term":"windDirectionRelativeToTrueNorth","desc":"Wind direction in degrees relative to true North. See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#windDirectionRelativeToTrueNorth","vocab":"MBGVLTS"},{"term":"visibilityInMeters","desc":"For aerial surveys: Estimated maximum distance from the plane in meters at which an animal can be observed on the water surface given the present environmental conditions. Different visibilities can be reported separately for left and right side of the plane if these are recorded. In this case the term will consist of two values separated by semicolons. The first term will describe the estimated visibility in meters for left side of the plane, and the second term will describe visibility in meters for the observer on the right side of the plane. If more than two observers record visibility information in meters these can be incorporated by formatting the contents using the Darwin core dynamic properties approach to key-value pairs (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#dynamicProperties). For boat-based surveys: Estimated maximum distance from the vessel in meters at which an animal can be observed on the water surface given the present environmental conditions, such as glare, rain, fog, sea state, swell height. See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#visibilityInMeters","vocab":"MBGVLTS"},{"term":"beaufortSeaState","desc":"Number corresponding to Beaufort sea state (scale 0 to 12) to describe sea conditions. See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#beaufortSeaState","vocab":"MBGVLTS"},{"term":"observersCounts","desc":"Integer labels and values for additional estimates of group size or counts. For visual line transect surveys this term may consist of separated values estimating group size (best estimate, minimum estimate, maximum estimate). This term is optional if survey protocols do not include additional group size estimates. The contents of such a list of counts is flexible, if other types of labels and counts are required and can include counts of number of calves. Format the contents using the Darwin core dynamic properties approach to key-value pairs (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#dynamicProperties). e.g. ¡§bestEstimate=10; minEstimate=8; maxEstimate=15; calves = 2¡¨. See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#observersCounts","vocab":"MBGVLTS"},{"term":"onEffort","desc":"One character string to flag whether a record was on effort or off-effort. The start and end of effort observations can be identified where there is a change from off effort to on effort and vice-versa. Examples of off-effort sightings records may include going off effort to approach animals to obtain better count information or photograph animals. Some position-only records may also occur off effort. Fixed vocabulary terms: Y = on effort, N = off effort. See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#onEffort","vocab":"MBGVLTS"},{"term":"platformVLTS","desc":"One-character string to flag survey platform type for visual line transect surveys. For aerial surveys: All records flagged ¡§A¡¨ For boat-based surveys: All records flagged ¡§B¡¨. See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#platformVLTS","vocab":"MBGVLTS"},{"term":"positionVLTS","desc":"One-character string to flag position only, non-sighting records (P) and additional platform position information when available. Position only-records are required for recording tracklines and may also include additional information on sighting conditions. All position-only records will be flagged ¡¥P¡¦ or ¡¥T¡¦ for turning, although flagging ¡¥T¡¦ is not required. Data providers should explain how frequently position only records were obtained (e.g. every 30 minutes) in the metadata. For sighting records this term describes the survey platform position during a sighting. Unless additional information is provided, all sighting records will be flagged as an observation location (O), or C for circling which may be on or off effort. This term records specific survey platform positions using the following fixed vocabulary: T = turning, C = circling, P = position only (non-turning), O = observation. See also http://rs.obis.org/mbg/terms/index.html#positionVLTS","vocab":"MBGVLTS"},{"term":"typeVLTS","desc":"One-character string to flag only the initial sighting records which can be used in density and abundance estimation. Opportunistic and subsequent sighting records can be included in the dataset, but these are easily identified from this term for exclusion from abundance and density modeling. The fixed vocabulary terms are: F = first observation sighting on transect, O = opportunistic sighting, S = subsequent sighting either on or off transect, Null = for position-only records or non-VLTS datasets.
